I'm a Frontend Web Developer. Enthusiast of continuous learning and constant
practice.

I have worked with Vue, Angular, React, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Golang, and other
technologies.

**I’m currently learning**

- Next.js: You can see my personal website.
- Vue: New features in version 3
- Firebase: Excellent platform, trying all the functions I can.

**Other technologies that I like**

- NoSQL: I like MongoDB and RethinkDB.
- GraphQL: Hope to learn soon.
